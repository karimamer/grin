idea:
  The runtime system collects data on demand.
  The user can specify the focus of inspection via a query language.

  The raw data is fed to the UI tool.
  e.g. grafana or custom implementation

debug trap triggers:
  - function call
  - release of specific resource or node

debug and profiling queries:
  - control flow traces

visualize:
  - hot spots of cfg
  - longest reference chain
  - longest thunk
  - memory usage
  - open resources
  - longest reference loop

summary:
  collectable data X query language X visualization
  many - connection - many


prototype:
  - visualize grin reference graph, with strict and lazy distinction

query language?
  graphql?
  purescript?
  gluon?
  haskell?

ideal query language:
  typed + inference
  code completion (type based)
  very simple

approach:
  iterative, agile, free
