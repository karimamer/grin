sum simple does not optimise to sum opt without update elimination (sharing analysis)
this means call by name is better to optimise than call by need?
i.e. an eval without update

question:
  is there a case when can call by need (with sharing analysis) would block further optimisations that was possible with call by name?


- new transformation / grin language modification
  for better accuracy each case alternative should introduce a new binder for the narrowed scrutinee,
  substitute the scritinee variable with the alternative's narrowed scrutinee version
