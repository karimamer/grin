# bidirectional analysis

reverse data flow arrows for more precision
  i.e. lambda patterns and case patterns defines the valid cases that the program could handle
        this can constrain the possible values further

# call by need is an optimisation for call by name

what if not the update elimination is the optimisation but the update insertion for call by name strategy to avoid redundancy

# rename eval and apply to builtin name

i.e. _prim_eval and _prim_apply
