The whole program AST could contain few million nodes. i.e. lambdacube-quake3 has ~1.1M nodes

This poses serious challenges for performace requirements.

Q:
- how far can we get with the current system design? (CPU, ShortText names, pointer tree)
  problems:
    - memory footprint
    - traversal speed
    - data-flow analysis speed
  possible improvements:
    - multithreading
    - int names + symbol table
    - c interpreter for data-flow machine
    - llvm jit for data-flow machine

Possible system designs:
  - data-flow analysis on GPU
  - packed AST representation
  - optimization passes on CPU with SPMD
  - optimization passes on GPU
